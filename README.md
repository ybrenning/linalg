# Linear Algebra

Implementing some basic Linear Algebra stuff in Python as practice for the Linear Algebra 1
course taught at the University of Leipzig.

The `Vector()` class implements the basic functionality of a $k$-dimensional vector, where $k > 1$.

The `Matrix()` class implements a Matrix of size $m \times n$, where $m, n \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$
